      <h3>Sam</h3>
      <p>Sam is the team’s sole Canadian, growing up just outside of Vancouver, BC. He did his first round of
        post-secondary at the age of 20, studying Media Arts while enduring the sub-zero temperatures of the
        Saskatchewan winters. Shortly after, he got married, had four kids, and decided it would be just great to do
        another round of post-secondary, this time in the area of web development. Sam now lives on Vancouver Island and
        spends his time finding a good balance between hanging out with his family, creating videos, and learning how to
        code.</p>

      <h3>Heidi</h3>
      <p>Heidi Kay is a 22-year-old barista living in the beautiful and unique Redding, California. She is newly married
        (almost a year), to the most handsome man in the world, Elijah Kay. She absolutely loves the outdoors, and LOVES
        to have fun. She will never say no to a beer and a taco truck.</p>
      <p>Heidi was home-schooled her whole life in a very very small town in the state of Texas, but never missed out on
        any fun times or opportunities to have community and be involved. Heidi’s goal is to be very successful in
        programming, all while continuing having a happy life and happy marriage.</p>

      <h3>Lewis</h3>
      <p>Lewis Hylton is a 29-year-old indestructible super dad, whose life is also dominated by solving the murder of
        his friend, Mace Windu . Mace was electrocuted, his arm was cut off, and he was thrown out a window, (ironic
        since his last name is Windu) on May 19, 2005. The killer was never brought to justice!</p>
      <p>He is a down to earth American who defines himself as incredibly diligent and hardworking. He finished school
        and will become a brilliant jr. developer. He is obsessed with Star Wars! Physically, Lewis is in pretty good
        shape. He is average-height with pale skin, green eyes, and ginormous muscles. He has a fully functioning x-wing
        in his garage. He plans on visiting his fellow developers in it, but only when they have finished their greatest
        achievement, Dreamscape a dream come true.</p>
      <p>Lewis's best friend is a voice actor named Mark Hamill. They are inseparable. Mark is a real joker! Lewis’
        greatest flaw is that he works too hard and for some odd reason he just doesn’t know when or how to give up.
        He’s planning on becoming a millionaire and giving jobs to Heidi, Sam, and Kellan. He is also wise though, he
        says he will make them start from the bottom and work their way up. He will show no partiality. Lewis is
        currently living comfortably in North Carolina with his 4 children.</p>
